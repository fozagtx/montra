# Smart Contract Integration Summary

## Contract Details
- **Address**: `0x64f07b7be711b4e85043f29d4fe2e04776111b51`
- **Network**: Push Testnet Donut (Chain ID: 42101)
- **RPC URL**: https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org

## Contract Functions Integrated

### 1. Payment Function: `pay(address payable payee, string productRef)`
- **Type**: Payable function (accepts native PUSH tokens)
- **Frontend Integration**: `components/buttonProvider.tsx`
  - Calls the `pay` function with buyer's payout address and product ID
  - Sends native PUSH tokens as payment value
  - No longer converts UUID to bigint - passes product ID as string directly

### 2. Verification Function: `verifyPayment(string productRef, address payer)`
- **Type**: View function
- **Backend Integration**: `app/api/payments/verify/route.ts`
  - Reads contract state to verify if a payment has been made
  - Takes product ID (string) and buyer address
  - Returns boolean indicating payment status

### 3. Payments View Function: `payments(string productRef)`
- **Type**: View function
- **Returns**: Payment details (payer, payee, amount, paid status, timestamp)
- **Note**: Available for future integration if detailed payment history is needed

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Contract Configuration (`contract.md`)
- Updated contract address to new deployment
- Updated ABI to match new contract interface
- Changed `purchaseFunction` from `purchaseProduct` to `pay`
- Changed `verifyFunction` from `hasPurchased` to `verifyPayment`
- Changed `paymentTokenDecimals` from 6 to 18 (native token)

### 2. Frontend Payment Flow (`components/buttonProvider.tsx`)
- Removed UUID to BigInt conversion (contract now accepts string)
- Changed function arguments from `[productKey, payoutAddress, amount]` to `[payoutAddress, productId]`
- Added `value` field to transaction (payable function)
- Updated display text from "USDC" to "PUSH"

### 3. Backend Verification (`app/api/payments/verify/route.ts`)
- Removed UUID to BigInt conversion
- Changed contract call arguments from `[buyer, productBigInt]` to `[productId, buyer]`
- Simplified verification logic

### 4. UI Updates
- **Product Page**: Updated payment text to reflect PushChain network and PUSH tokens
- **Dashboard**: Changed revenue display from "USDC earned" to "PUSH earned"
- **Product Listings**: Updated price display from "USDC" to "PUSH"
- **Create Form**: Updated labels and descriptions to reflect PUSH payments

## Payment Flow

### Customer Flow
1. Customer visits product page (`/product/[id]`)
2. Customer connects their PushChain wallet
3. Customer clicks "Pay X PUSH" button
4. Transaction is sent to contract: `pay(creatorAddress, productId)` with PUSH value
5. Frontend verifies payment via `/api/payments/verify`
6. On successful verification, customer receives product access link

### Creator Flow
1. Creator signs up and logs in
2. Creator creates product with title, description, URL, wallet address, and price
3. Product is stored in Supabase with UUID
4. Creator shares payment link
5. When payments are received, they appear in dashboard analytics

### Verification Flow
1. Frontend calls `/api/payments/verify` with productId and buyer address
2. Backend calls `verifyPayment(productId, buyer)` on smart contract
3. Contract returns true/false if payment exists
4. Backend retrieves product URL from Supabase
5. Returns verification status and product URL to frontend
6. Frontend displays "Access your product" button with download link

## Database Schema
- Products table: Stores product details with `price_usdc` column (now holds PUSH amount)
- Payments table: Records completed transactions with `amount_usdc` column (now holds PUSH amount)
- Note: Column names kept as-is for backward compatibility, but values now represent PUSH tokens

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Product creation works with new contract
- [ ] Payment button appears on product pages
- [ ] Wallet connection works on PushChain testnet
- [ ] Payment transaction executes successfully
- [ ] Payment verification returns correct status
- [ ] Product URL is delivered after successful payment
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct payment information

## Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHCHAIN_RPC_URL` (optional, defaults from contract.md)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHCHAIN_CHAIN_ID` (optional, defaults from contract.md)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHCHAIN_EXPLORER_URL` (optional, defaults from contract.md)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHCHAIN_NETWORK_KEY` (optional, defaults to TESTNET_DONUT)

## Notes
- The contract uses native PUSH tokens instead of USDC
- Product IDs are now passed as strings instead of uint256
- Payment amounts use 18 decimals (native token) instead of 6 (USDC)
- All on-chain verification happens through the new contract
- Database schema unchanged to maintain backward compatibility
