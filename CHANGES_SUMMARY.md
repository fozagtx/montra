# Changes Summary - Smart Contract Integration

## Overview
Integrated the deployed PushChain payment contract (0x64f07b7be711b4e85043f29d4fe2e04776111b51) with the frontend and backend to enable complete payment flow using native PUSH tokens.

## Files Modified

### 1. contract.md
**Purpose**: Contract configuration file  
**Changes**:
- Updated contract address from `0xcecbf89ad2db3601b6cc7803470cfa15ce8c213a` to `0x64f07b7be711b4e85043f29d4fe2e04776111b51`
- Replaced entire ABI with new contract's ABI (4 entries: pay, PaymentMade event, payments, verifyPayment)
- Changed `purchaseFunction` from `purchaseProduct` to `pay`
- Changed `verifyFunction` from `hasPurchased` to `verifyPayment`
- Updated `paymentTokenDecimals` from 6 to 18 (native token vs USDC)
- Contract now accepts string productRef instead of uint256 productId

### 2. components/buttonProvider.tsx
**Purpose**: Frontend payment button and wallet integration  
**Changes**:
- Removed import of `uuidToBigInt` helper (no longer needed)
- Removed UUID to BigInt conversion logic
- Changed `encodeFunctionData` args from `[productKey, payoutAddress, amount]` to `[payoutAddress, productId]`
- Added `value: amount` to transaction object (payable function)
- Updated button label from "Pay X USDC" to "Pay X PUSH"

**Before**:
```typescript
const productKey = uuidToBigInt(productId);
const data = encodeFunctionData({
  args: [productKey, payoutAddress, amount]
});
await sendTransaction({ to: address, data });
```

**After**:
```typescript
const data = encodeFunctionData({
  args: [payoutAddress, productId]
});
await sendTransaction({ to: address, data, value: amount });
```

### 3. app/api/payments/verify/route.ts
**Purpose**: Backend payment verification endpoint  
**Changes**:
- Removed import of `uuidToBigInt` helper
- Removed UUID to BigInt conversion logic
- Changed `readContract` args from `[buyer, productBigInt]` to `[productId, buyer]`
- Simplified verification flow by passing product ID as string

**Before**:
```typescript
const productBigInt = uuidToBigInt(productId);
const result = await publicClient.readContract({
  args: [buyer, productBigInt]
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const result = await publicClient.readContract({
  args: [productId, buyer]
});
```

### 4. app/product/[id]/page.tsx
**Purpose**: Product detail page  
**Changes**:
- Updated badge display from "${price} USDC" to "{price} PUSH"
- Changed description from "Pay securely with USDC on Base network" to "Pay securely with PUSH on PushChain network"
- Updated "Secure Base network payment" to "Secure PushChain network payment"

### 5. app/dashboard/page.tsx
**Purpose**: Creator dashboard overview  
**Changes**:
- Updated revenue card from "USDC earned" to "PUSH earned"
- Changed product price display from "${price} USDC" to "{price} PUSH"

### 6. app/dashboard/products/page.tsx
**Purpose**: Product listing page  
**Changes**:
- Updated product badge from "{price} USDC" to "{price} PUSH"

### 7. components/createProductForm.tsx
**Purpose**: Product creation form  
**Changes**:
- Updated label from "Your Base Wallet Address" to "Your Wallet Address"
- Changed helper text from "USDC payments will be sent to this address on Base" to "PUSH payments will be sent to this address on PushChain"
- Updated price label from "Price (USDC)" to "Price (PUSH)"

## Technical Changes Summary

### Contract Interface Changes
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Contract Address | 0xcecb...213a | 0x64f0...1b51 |
| Token Type | ERC-20 USDC | Native PUSH |
| Token Decimals | 6 | 18 |
| Product ID Type | uint256 | string |
| Purchase Function | purchaseProduct | pay |
| Purchase Args | (uint256, address, uint256) | (address payable, string) |
| Verify Function | hasPurchased | verifyPayment |
| Verify Args | (address, uint256) | (string, address) |
| Transaction Type | Contract call | Payable transaction |

### Code Simplifications
1. **No more UUID conversion**: Product IDs passed directly as strings
2. **Simpler transaction encoding**: Just payee address and product ID
3. **Native token payments**: No ERC-20 approval needed
4. **Cleaner verification**: Direct string comparison on-chain

### Breaking Changes
- ⚠️ Old contract is no longer supported
- ⚠️ All new payments must go through new contract
- ⚠️ Historical data in database still references old contract
- ✅ No database schema changes needed (backward compatible)

## Testing Status

### Completed
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ TypeScript types check
- ✅ Contract configuration parsing validated
- ✅ Transaction encoding verified
- ✅ Function signatures match contract ABI

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Product creation flow
- [ ] Wallet connection on PushChain testnet
- [ ] Payment transaction execution
- [ ] Payment verification via contract
- [ ] Product URL delivery after payment
- [ ] Dashboard analytics display

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: No new variables needed; all config in contract.md
2. **Database**: No migrations required; existing schema compatible
3. **Frontend**: Build succeeds; no dependencies added
4. **Backend**: API routes updated; no breaking changes to REST interface

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert contract.md to previous version
2. Revert changes to buttonProvider.tsx and verify/route.ts
3. Revert UI text changes (optional, cosmetic only)
4. Previous contract will resume working

## Next Steps

1. Test payment flow end-to-end on testnet
2. Verify payment confirmations in dashboard
3. Test with multiple products and users
4. Monitor transaction success rates
5. Consider adding event listeners for PaymentMade events

## Notes

- Database columns still named `price_usdc` and `amount_usdc` but now contain PUSH values
- This maintains backward compatibility without schema migrations
- Column names are just identifiers; semantics have changed
- Consider renaming columns in future major version
